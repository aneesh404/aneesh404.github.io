## Experience

### Software Engineer (Platform)  
**Zeta – Bangalore, IN**  
*Jan 2024 – Present*  
- Designed and deployed a forward proxy Kubernetes controller for active-active and active-passive disaster recovery (DR), enabling seamless traffic failovers and reducing downtime.  
- Developed an egress traffic controller to enhance outbound traffic security and monitoring, enabling domain-level whitelisting for over 1,500 microservices.  
- Achieved a 98% reduction in production vulnerabilities by leading an initiative to minimize the attack surface and implementing robust automated security checks within CI/CD pipelines.  
- Migrated Kong API Gateway from Ubuntu to a distroless container image, significantly reducing the attack surface area, and contributed the implementation to the open-source Kong community.  
- Built advanced Kong Gateway plugins, adding functionality for audit logging, entity extraction, response transformation, and header validation.  

### Software Engineer (Fullstack)  
**Groww – Bangalore, IN**  
*Jan 2022 – Jan 2024*  
- Developed a platform enabling developers to seamlessly deploy, manage, and modify their software workloads with end-to-end automation; accelerating development cycles across the organization by at least 2x.  
- Configured and tuned a high-performance reverse proxy serving 50,000+ RPM at peak traffic, replacing Varnish and improving response times by >10x, while reducing infrastructure costs by 25%.  
- Built monitoring and alerting platforms for Kafka and certificate management, currently managing observability for 300+ Kafka consumers and 25+ certificates.  

### Student Developer  
**CERN – Google Summer of Code, Remote**  
*Jun 2021 – Aug 2021*  
- Designed and developed an open-source GPU benchmarking suite for testing partitioned GPU in a vendor-agnostic nature; done in collaboration with researchers from CERN as part of GSoC 2021.  
- Presented the project at CERN Lightning Talks, receiving positive feedback from scientists at CERN.  

### Perception Apprentice/Engineer  
**Project Manas – Manipal, IN**  
*Feb 2019 – Feb 2021*  
- Improved the performance of semantic segmentation by integrating techniques from state-of-the-art (SoTA) models like Deeplabv3+, achieving up to a 30% accuracy boost.  
- Implemented lane detection using a lightweight model, contributing to the development of a comprehensive computer vision stack for our unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that won IGVC 2019.  
- Team efforts in the autonomous car division won us the Mahindra Rise Prize award.
