Developed an egress traffic controller to enhance outbound traffic security and monitoring, enabling domain-level whitelisting for over 1,500 microservices. Achieved a 98% reduction in production vulnerabilities by leading an initiative to minimize the attack surface and implementing robust automated security checks within CI/CD pipelines. Migrated Kong API Gateway from Ubuntu to a distroless container image, significantly reducing the attack surface area, and contributed the implementation to the open-source Kong community. Built advanced Kong Gateway plugins, adding functionality for audit logging, entity extraction, response transformation, and header validation. Software Engineer (Fullstack) Groww – Bangalore, IN\nJan 2022 – Jan 2024\nDeveloped a platform enabling developers to seamlessly deploy, manage, and modify their software workloads with end-to-end automation; accelerating development cycles across the organization by at least 2x. Configured and tuned a high-performance reverse proxy serving 50,000+ RPM at peak traffic, replacing Varnish and improving response times by \u0026gt;10x, while reducing infrastructure costs by 25%. Built monitoring and alerting platforms for Kafka and certificate management, currently managing observability for 300+ Kafka consumers and 25+ certificates. Student Developer CERN – Google Summer of Code, Remote\nJun 2021 – Aug 2021\nDesigned and developed an open-source GPU benchmarking suite for testing partitioned GPU in a vendor-agnostic nature; done in collaboration with researchers from CERN as part of GSoC 2021. Presented the project at CERN Lightning Talks, receiving positive feedback from scientists at CERN. Perception Apprentice/Engineer Project Manas – Manipal, IN\nFeb 2019 – Feb 2021\nImproved the performance of semantic segmentation by integrating techniques from state-of-the-art (SoTA) models like Deeplabv3+, achieving up to a 30% accuracy boost. Implemented lane detection using a lightweight model, contributing to the development of a comprehensive computer vision stack for our unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that won IGVC 2019. Team efforts in the autonomous car division won us the Mahindra Rise Prize award.
